Welcome to my website! I am graduate student at [Mathematics and Statistics department](https://www.math.wsu.edu/) of [Washington State University](https://www.vancouver.wsu.edu/). My research interest is in optimal power flow for smart grids with ideas from degree theory.

I am advised by [Bala Krishnamoorthy](https://www.math.wsu.edu/faculty/bkrishna/).
